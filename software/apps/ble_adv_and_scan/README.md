BLE Advertise and Scan
======================

Example of receiving BLE advertisements while also advertising. By default, a
message stating that an advertisement has been received is printed through RTT.
The name of the device is also advertised while doing so. This briefly stops
scanning while the advertisement is sent, but that action happens automatically
in the library.
